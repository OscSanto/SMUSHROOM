To export character with textures (and in general):
File > export > fbx > select path mode "COPY" > turn on "embeded textures" (option next to path mode) > export to github


=======BEFORE EXPORTING======
1)Make sure you have "selected objects" selected.
	Select only the objects you want to export.
2)Apply scalings: FBX units scale
3)Forward: Y forward
	Attention to character transform rotation "forward" for exporting characters into unity.
	In blender, characters should face the "Y" axis. This is unitys "forward". 
4)If exporting animation:
   Bake Animations: on
	NLA Strips: on
	All actions: off
